I've paid my toll for dreary days,  

A weight of grief echoes: I am an alien here.  

You've drained this spirit, and now, in aftermath's shadow,  

I bathe in the remnants, in ashes.  

Here lies a room kissed by sun, its light not yours to claim,  

The sun, after all, resides in my chest.  

To move with grace, it's a power I hold within,  

A strength I harbor, time and again.

A million times, broken, scattered,  

Yet each fragment shines more intensely.  

The sky I crafted, it never bore your signature,  

In the aftermath, I always unearth a precious calm.

Where my words find their kin,  

Hoping, one day, another  

Will grasp them, not through laborious learning, but an intuitive blend.  

Every word, every whisper, known, felt, deep in the marrow,  

I believe, with unwavering certainty, in tomorrow.
