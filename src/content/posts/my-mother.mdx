In the shadowed corners of childhood,  

I lingered, a restless spirit in the gloom.  

My questions, like autumn leaves,  

Fell endlessly around her patient bloom.

"Mother," I whispered in the dim light,  

My voice a haunting echo in our space.  

Annoying? A persistent ghost, perhaps,  

Yet she never turned away her face.

Her words cutting through the distance.

Oh, Mother, in your silent strength,  

Your love, a muted, yet enduring hue.  

In the Plathian night of my soul,  

I find the gentlest part of you.
