Give people their space.
Focus on your own journey.
Respect yourself, tenderly.
Don't let life's troubles weigh you down.
Sing with all your heart to the music.
Look in the mirrorâ€”dance with joy.
Smile warmly at the tram driver.
Call your loved ones.
Tell them, you love em.
When times are tough, let your tears flow freely.
Run swiftly and with purpose.
Feel the anger if you must.
But love this life deeply.
As long as love fills your heart,
Step into the garden.
Protect it gently.
Let it grow as it will.
Let yourself be.
And cherish the love you find.
