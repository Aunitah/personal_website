Three years have ebbed away since I last felt my mother's reassuring presence; my grandmother now battles with the relentless advance of liver cancer. My father remains a distant, unspoken thought. Love, in its traditional guise, has eluded me, yet I've discovered it in unexpected places and forms. But these revelations do little to assuage my sense of drifting, of repeating mistakes whose lessons remain unlearned. The clarity and conviction of youth have dissolved; I am adrift in a sea of uncertainty.

Once, as a child, my decisions were swift and unwavering. I recall the ritual of choosing a dress for a wedding party: my eyes would fixate on the first dress that caught my fancy. Yet, my mother would urge patience, the promise of something better in the next store. Hours later, I would often circle back to that first choice. Now, standing at life's myriad crossroads, I wonder if the best choices were those first instincts, or if the elusive 'better' still lies ahead, just out of reach.

In this liminal space, where certainty once stood, I find myself grappling with a sense of futility. The world moves on, indifferent to my stagnation. Yet, the fire of ambition, the thirst for purpose, seems to have dimmed within me. Is this the inevitable march of adulthood - a gradual numbing of the heart?

But then, in the quiet solitude of my thoughts, I find solace in words. They are steadfast companions, stories of hope and resilience. I yearn to share a drink with Sylvia Plath, to delve into the depths of her tumultuous spirit. To watch a sunset with Forough Farrokhzad and speak of the courage she's instilled in me. These musings, these silent conversations, rekindle a spark. Inspiration, it seems, was never lost - just waiting to be found in a sentence, the embrace of a metaphor. Perhaps what my heart seeks is not a ceaseless pursuit, but a moment to breathe, to find peace in the world's simple beauties.
