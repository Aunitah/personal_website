I hear the unkind melody of rain,  
How the earth is beaten by this cruel beauty.  
Time to mute my music, this pain demands attention.  
Engulfed by many emotions, I'm swept into the melancholy tune,  
A forgotten cup of tea, and a blanket that never quite warms.  
Rain, making the streets too daunting to flee, that unkind distance.  
All is foggy, and I can't see your face clearly in my weary mind, you're so far away.  
So far.  
It's time for a fresh cup of tea.  
I pen another poem.  
Damn, I forgot again.  
This cold tea.
