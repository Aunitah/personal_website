In brilliance they stand
Their perfection so sharp
Cuts through the veil of mediocrity with precision
But oh where the purity?
A delicate whisper of tender grace
Intimate connections,
Woven in my flowing hair
A genuine gesture, sincere,
warmth that doesn't rely on unnecessary niceties
Where would I find that
Tell me where
