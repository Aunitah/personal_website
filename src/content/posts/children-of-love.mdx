I understand now  
how blessed the children born of love are.  
I understand where they come from,  
how they come to be.  
When you love someone so deeply,  
so deeply that it never feels enough,  
you see them, and still, it's not enough,  
no matter how tightly you hold them.  
They are a part of you,  
and you want them back inside,  
woven into your very soul.  
That love grows so vast,  
that our bodies, our minds, our everything cannot contain it—  
so another existence is born.
