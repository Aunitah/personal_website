Drink deeply of the sea and lift me ever upwards,

Rest awhile, and with your truth, refresh my spirit.
Guide me deep into your thoughts, planting belief,
Murmur of the ocean's blue, the sky's claim on stars.
Your presence eclipses other thoughts, mere ephemera,
Echoes from alternate worlds.
Pen the wonders of this world, its awe-inspiring essence.
Welcome me into your world of wonder.
Rejecting the given hues, we choose our own palette,
Together, we paint the gardens.
No vows, no tempests, just atoms in communion,
Feeling their intrinsic kinship.
Nothing and everything holds significance, your essence paramount.
Melodies resonate sweetness,
Rhythm and words reign supreme,
Jazz resonates just as it should.
No desire for change,
Fingers dance lightly across piano keys,
A child's first steps, amidst Cheetos and ice cream.
Gazing once more at the stars,
Surely the same ones I yearned for at five, now indelibly marked, seen by you too.
Together, yet apart, we've gazed upon them, in times gone by.
The stars, making no promises,
Simply stood as a testament to our shared gaze in this reality,
Years later.
In their twinkle,
A silent acknowledgement.
