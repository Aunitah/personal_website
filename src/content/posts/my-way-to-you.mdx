You gently took my head in your strong hands,  
"Let me get that for you," you said softly,  
Carefully lifting the eyelash from my face.  
My heart pounded, a reminder to wish,  
Quickly, before it was gone.  
I looked into your green eyes,  
Where the sun found a warm welcome.  
I looked at your sweet lips,  
And it felt so natural.  
I wished for you,  
To be with you,  
To find my way to you.  

I wished for you.
