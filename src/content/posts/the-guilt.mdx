How far I've come, free from the guilt,  
All those times I looked back, unable to stop,  
Feeling guilty for being happy,  
Tasting freedom while another part of the world burned,  
My heart on fire.  
It was hard to feel happiness without guilt,  
How far have I come to find peace within,  
To not feel guilty anymore?  
But now I see a heartless soul,  
A selfish kind,  
Thirsty for ambition.  
Individualism shapes me,  
It saved me from that hell on the other side of the world,  
Where everyone suffers now.  
How can I be at peace while they still suffer?  
My mom,  
My dad,  
I can't even help myself,  
How can I help them?  
I only saved myself from that hell,  
Now the souls I left behind haunt me.
