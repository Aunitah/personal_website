In the heart of Switzerland, a single moment encapsulated a lifetime of memories. There, on a street far from our beginnings, the three of us - sister, brother, cousin - found ourselves together again. It was as if the universe had conspired to bring us to this point, a reunion that transcended the mere crossing of borders.

Our journey hadn't been easy. We emerged from the winding alleys of Esfahan, carrying with us nights filled with doubts, days of hope, and the unyielding belief that we would make it. And there we were, walking side by side in Switzerland, a testament to our resilience and unbreakable bond.

I remember telling myself, "Focus, suck in, absorb all this feeling." This wasn't just a stroll; it was a moment to be savored, a memory to be cherished. As I looked at them, my heart swelled with an unspoken understanding. "Guys, we made it," I said, our smiles reflecting a shared journey of struggle and success.

Closing my eyes, I briefly met my younger self, the child who once roamed the streets of Panj Tabaghe, innocent and unaware of the adventures that lay ahead. Reopening them, I found myself back in the present, surrounded by the warmth of their presence. We had no destination; our journey was about being together, about reaching a place beyond physical locations.

In that moment, the past and the present converged. We were no longer defined by the distance or the challenges we had overcome. We were simply together, our steps in sync, our hearts united. This was our favorite form of meditation, a way to anchor ourselves in the joy of the present.

Even oceans apart, this moment would remain with us, a beacon of our enduring connection. From the dusty paths of our childhood to the serene streets of Switzerland, we had journeyed far, both in miles and in experiences. "Feel the moment," I reminded myself. "We are together, we made it out of the past. We are in peace. We are in grace."
