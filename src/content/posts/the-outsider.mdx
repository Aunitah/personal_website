Belonging to Nothing

I hated small towns, suffocating me in their embrace
And big cities, their vastness a maze
I just wanted to fit in, to belong
But to no place or person did I truly belong
Perhaps a book, a poem, a fleeting thought
Or a stray cat, a smile that I caught
Moments that come and go, never to stay
My existence a cycle of endings and new days
Pain and joy, they both come in turn
Happiness fleeting, but oh so pure
I seek neutrality, a break from it all
But in the end, belonging to nothing at all
So I'll embrace the endings, each a new start
Beginnings that bring hope to my heart
For I belong to the moments, ever-changing and free
And that's where I find my true identity.
