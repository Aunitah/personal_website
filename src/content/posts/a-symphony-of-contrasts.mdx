Lost in the beauty that surrounds me.

I forget all sense of direction.

.

.

.

The music filled the air that night,

A band on Yong St. played with delight.

I stayed for hours, watching and swaying,

Drinking in the sights and sounds, no delaying.

My aunt grew restless, wanting me to join,

To dance in the circle and feel the joy.

But I stood still, my smile wide,

Content to watch, to simply abide.

As I captured a man dancing on my phone,

My thoughts took me to lands far from home.

To places where laughter is a crime,

Where freedom is scarce, a precious dime.

Dancing in public

A punishable scar

The contrast was stark, the privilege so clear,

How some are fighting while others live without fear

I remembered the warnings from my youth,

The glances, the sneers, the unkind truth.

How different the world can be,

One half fighting, the other set free.

Yet, in this moment, all that fades,

The music, the dancing, the lights cascade.

Lost in the beauty of the night,

I am content to wander, to take flight.

For every time I am lost in these beauties,

I am reminded of life's simple duties.

To live, to love, to appreciate,

And never let the world's harshness dictate.

So I embrace my wanderlust, my dreamer's heart,

Knowing that beauty will always be my art.

And though I may be lost in these moments divine,

I am never truly lost, for beauty is always mine.
