Do we make movies because they depict lives we can never live? It's a bit disheartening to think about. We spend our lives watching these idealized versions of life, knowing we can never actually experience them. The entire movie industry thrives on this.

Then it got me thinking: do we listen to music because it expresses the emotions we wish we could convey, the words we wish to hear but would never? 

Do we write poetry because it captures the words we long to say but could never do? It's as if we are living in a parallel world, one that isn't ours. We don't truly live in it; we're merely spectators. But I don't want to be just a spectator.

I want to live that life, here and now, in this world, not anywhere else. 

Easy to say, but I at least
want to try!
