Mom, I'm hiding from the phone. Not wanting to let you down is why. I can't say I'm hungry, can't say I'm blue. Up here, where happiness should be easy, I find it hard. You're in a tougher spot, I know, and I should be grateful. You'd give anything to be here, where dreams are supposed to live. Especially yours, Mom. But here I am, feeling lost in this dream. So, I'm silent, because sadness has found me again. I'm hungry, broke, and alone. Disappointing you is my biggest fear. I aim to make you proud, just need a moment. A moment to gather good news, to find my way. I'll call, Mom, with stories to lift your heart. I promise to make you proud. Just a bit more time. That's all I ask.
