To heal myself,  
for if I could,  
I'd sing until the world's edge,  
free as any bird.  
I'd play the piano till the keys broke free,  
till the music played itself.  
I'd write and never stop,  
but for now,  
there's a wounded world that waits,  
aching for my cure.  
For now, I sing the loudest song in my mind,  
listen to every piano note on my walk to the hospital.  
For now, I save,  
for that is the love rooted deep in me,  
the song my ancestors sang me into.  
This is my calling, my duty.  
Until one day, I sing freely again.
I just hope, someday, I'll be saved too.
