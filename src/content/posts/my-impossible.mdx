If I could ever go back, I would hug my friend tighter and tell my mom I love her cooking. I wouldn't worry about the bugs and would lay on the grass in the yard. I would read all of my books. I think I would fear less and leave my bedroom more often. I think I would run faster and swim more. I would hug my grandma and talk louder for my dad and grandpa. I would not worry about my acne and would not cover myself as much under that hijab. I would see my friend more often and open up to her. I would trust more. I would ask my mom more questions about her life and her childhood. I would watch more movies with her. I would cook for my family and be less mean of a girl. That is, if I could go back. If I could. And if I could go back, I know I would feel familiarity, but I would be a stranger. I know I would smell the old days, but the old me does not know how to sit with ease. That is, if I could. I know I can't. I know I can't.
